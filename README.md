Low Fidelity Prototype

Above is the low fidelity prototype. The temporary email address and time left before it is deleted are listed on top, followed by an option to create a new email. This button will cause the old temporary email to be deleted (if it already exists) and create a new email. Below that button is the trash and refresh buttons, which modify the inbox. Below the inbox is an option to extend the default time before deletion, which utilizes a modal to go through the options for extension time.
